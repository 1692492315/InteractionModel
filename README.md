# Code for the article "A synchronized multi-step wind speed prediction with adaptive features and parameters selection: Insights from an interaction model".


Data availability
We have used two well-known datasets (https://github.com/meteostat) and compared our proposed model with the latest techniques.
The dataset of wind farm in Shandong province involves a confidentiality agreement and therefore the authors do not have permission to share it.


Multi-objective differential evolution is implemented using the algorithmic package "platypus-opt", version 1.1.0, open source at https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Platypus.


Deep learning models are implemented using the algorithmic package "tensorflow", version 2.4.0, open source at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.
